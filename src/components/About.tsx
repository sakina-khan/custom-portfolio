        "I'm Sakina Khan, a dedicated student pursuing a Bachelor's in Business and Information Technology. My passion lies at the intersection of technology and business, where I enjoy creating innovative solutions that bridge the gap between technical capabilities and strategic goals.

I’ve recently enhanced my skills through the prestigious Governor's Initiative course, where I gained hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies like TypeScript, Next.js, AI, HTML, and CSS. I’m always eager to take on challenges that allow me to grow and make a meaningful impact in the tech and business world."
